### Communication between layers

- UI calls method from ViewModel.
- ViewModel executes required Use case.
- Use cases gets data from Repository based on internet availability.
- Repository can return data from local/remote datasource w/o internet it fetches from local and
  from remote if internet is present.
- If internet is not present or data is not cached user is show a retry screen to Retry.
- Information flows back to the UI where we display the results in RecyclerView.

### Things that can be improved :

1. Return cached data in case of API/Server errors.
2. Notify user that you are seeing cached data please connect to internet if user's internet is not
   available and results were returned from local data source.
